All of the codes are for understanding how to use ray, ray RLlib for my thesis which is "Reinforcement Learning based Automated Parking Systems".
I made 3 types of codes.
1st type of codes contains "environment name_training" which is for training agents.
2nd type of codes are without "*_training" and visualize the environment and agent to see how the agent works in the environment.
3rd type of codes are for improving the process of reinforcement learning and my thesis to work smoothly.
